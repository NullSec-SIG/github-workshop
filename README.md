# github-workshop

Welcome to the repository for NullSec and Overflow's joint workshop on Git and GitHub! This repository contains a few things to show you the basics of a repository.

> **What's this?**
>
> This file you're reading now is known as a [README file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes). It's a special file in open source projects and repositories used to provide information on the project. GitHub parses and renders GitHub files in a special way, which is why if you drop by the [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/NullSec-SIG/github-workshop) you'll be able to see this file displayed.

## Features

Some Git and GitHub features covered in the workshop includes:

- GitHub Issues
- Pull requests
- GitHub Discussions
- GitHub Projects

## Collaborating

Feel free to make a fork and create a pull request if there's anything more you'd like to add. Whether it's editing a simple mistake or suggesting something new, help is appreciated! Do try to create an Issue first to see if your idea is worth exploring beforehand.
